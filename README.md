# Kite
### Yet another "Yet another Lisp implementation"

Internet is full of husks of half-baked Lisp implementations.
This one is mine. Kite is implemented in Python; supports 
dynamic scoping; quoting via quotation mark; basic file loading
and has a REPL. It's based on the original "Recursive Functions
of Symbolic Expressions [...]" paper by John McCarthy.

### Usage

```
python -m kite
```

### Local installation

```python
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```
